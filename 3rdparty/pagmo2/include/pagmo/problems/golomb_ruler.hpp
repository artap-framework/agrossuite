/// The Golomb Ruler Problem
/**

 * \image html golomb_ruler.png "The optimal Golomb Ruler of order 4" width=3cm
 *
 * In mathematics, a Golomb ruler is a set of marks at integer positions along an imaginary ruler such that no two pairs
 * of marks are the same distance apart. The number of marks on the ruler is its order, and the largest distance between
 * two of its marks is its length. Translation and reflection of a Golomb ruler are considered trivial, so the smallest
 * mark is customarily put at 0 and the next mark at the smaller of its two possible values.  There is no requirement
 * that a Golomb ruler be able to measure all distances up to its length, but if it does, it is called a perfect Golomb
 * ruler.
 *
 * A Golomb ruler is optimal if no shorter Golomb ruler of the same order exists. Creating Golomb rulers is easy,
 * but finding the optimal Golomb ruler (or rulers) for a specified order is computationally very challenging.
 *
 * This UDP represents the problem of finding an optimal Golomb ruler of a given order \f$ n\f$. A maximal distance \f$
 * l_{max}\f$ between consecutive marks is also specified to make the problem representation possible. The resulting
 * optimization problem is an integer programming problem with one equality constraint.
 *
 * In this UDP, the decision vector is \f$ x=[d_1, d_2, d_{n-1}]\f$, where the distances between consecutive ticks are
 * indicated with \f$ d_i\f$. The ticks on the ruler can then be reconstructed as \f$ a_0 = 0\f$, \f$ a_i = sum_{j=1}^i
 * d_i, i=1 .. n-1\f$
 *
 * Its formulation can thus be written as:
 *
 * \f[
 *   \begin{array}{rl}
 *   \mbox{find:} & 1 \le d_i \le l_{max}, \forall i=1..n-1 \\
 *   \mbox{to minimize: } & \sum_i d_i  \\
 *   \mbox{subject to:} & |a_i-a_j| \neq |a_l - a_m|, \forall (\mbox{distinct}) i,j,l,m \in [0, n]
 * \end{array}
 * \f]
 *
 * We transcribe the constraints as one single equality constraint: \f$ c = 0 \f$ where \f$ c\f$ is the count of
 * repeated distances.
 *
