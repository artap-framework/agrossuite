/// Van der Corput sequence
/**
 * A Van der Corput sequence is the simplest one-dimensional low-discrepancy sequence over the
 * unit interval; it was first described in 1935 by the Dutch mathematician Johannes van der Corput.
 * It is constructed by reversing the base representation of the sequence of natural number (1, 2, 3, â€¦).
 * A positive integer \f$n \ge 1\f$ is represented, in the base \f$b\f$ by:
 * \f[
 * n = \sum_{i=0}^{L-1}d_i(n) b^i,
 * \f]
 * where \f$L\f$ is the number of digits needed.
 * The \f$n\f$-th number in a van der Corput sequence is thus defined as:
 * \f[
 * g_n=\sum_{i=0}^{L-1}d_i(n) b^{-i-1}.
 * \f]
 *
 * so that, for example, if \f$b = 10\f$:
 *
 * \f$ seq = \{ 0, \tfrac{1}{10}, \tfrac{2}{10}, \tfrac{3}{10}, \tfrac{4}{10}, \tfrac{5}{10}, \tfrac{6}{10},
 * \tfrac{7}{10}, \tfrac{8}{10}, \tfrac{9}{10}, \tfrac{1}{100}, \tfrac{11}{100}, \tfrac{21}{100},
 * \tfrac{31}{100}, \tfrac{41}{100}, \tfrac{51}{100}, \tfrac{61}{100}, \tfrac{71}{100}, \tfrac{81}{100},
 * \tfrac{91}{100}, \tfrac{2}{100}, \tfrac{12}{100}, \tfrac{22}{100}, \tfrac{32}{100}, \ldots \} \,\f$
 *
 * or, if \f$b = 2\f$:
 *
 * \f$ seq = \{0, \tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{4}, \tfrac{3}{4}, \tfrac{1}{8}, \tfrac{5}{8}, \tfrac{3}{8},
 * \tfrac{7}{8}, \tfrac{1}{16}, \tfrac{9}{16}, \tfrac{5}{16}, \tfrac{13}{16}, \tfrac{3}{16}, \tfrac{11}{16},
 * \tfrac{7}{16}, \tfrac{15}{16}, \ldots.\} \f$
