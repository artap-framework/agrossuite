/// (N+1)-ES Simple Evolutionary Algorithm
/**
 * \image html sea.png
 *
 * Evolutionary strategies date back to the mid 1960s when P. Bienert,
 * I. Rechenberg, and H.-P. Schwefel at the Technical University of Berlin, Germany,
 * developed the first bionics-inspired schemes for evolving optimal shapes of
 * minimal drag bodies in a wind tunnel using Darwin's evolution principle.
 *
 * This c++ class represents the simplest evolutionary strategy, where a
 * population of \f$ \lambda \f$ individuals at each generation produces one offspring
 * by mutating its best individual uniformly at random within the bounds. Should the
 * offspring be better than the worst individual in the population it will substitute it.
 *
 * \verbatim embed:rst:leading-asterisk
 *
 * .. warning::
 *
 *    The algorithm is not suitable for multi-objective problems, nor for
 *    constrained or stochastic optimization
 *
 * .. note::
 *
 *    The mutation is uniform within box-bounds. Hence, unbounded problems will produce undefined
 *    behaviours.
 *
 * .. seealso::
