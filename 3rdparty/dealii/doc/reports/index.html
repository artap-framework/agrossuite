<h1>Reports</h1>

<p>
  There are a number of papers that describe the overall design or
  individual aspects of <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. Please refer to the
  papers listed at the top of the <a href="../publications/index.html"
				     target="body">publications page</a> for full references. In addition,
  there are the following reports:
  <ul>
    <li>
      A brief report about the classes involved in the
      <a href="http://www.dealii.org/reports/class-hierarchies/index.html"
         target="body">iterators and accessors</a>
      used to access cells in the triangulations and the data
      thereon, such as their geometry, the number of the
      degrees of freedom, data values, etc. You may want to
      read this object or parts of it if you want to know what
      information is available from iterators (by Wolfgang
      Bangerth).
    </li>

    <li>
      A brief report on <a href="http://www.dealii.org/reports/mapping_q/index.html"
			   target="body">mapping</a> functions of higher polynomial
      degrees (by Ralf Hartmann). These allow the realisation
      of higher order boundary approximations. This report
      gives the theoretical background of the
      <code>MappingQ</code> class.
    </li>

    <li>
      A report on
      <a href="http://www.dealii.org/reports/assemble/assemble.pdf"
         target="body">assembling matrices</a> (by Wolfgang
      Bangerth). This report looks in particular at how
      matrices are assembled for vector-valued problems, and
      how things change if vector-valued finite elements are
      used for which the shape functions have more than one
      non-zero vector component, such as Nedelec or
      Raviart-Thomas elements.
    </li>

    <li>
      A very detailed report on
      <a href="http://www.dealii.org/reports/nedelec/nedelec.pdf"
         target="body">Nedelec elements</a> (by Anna
      Schneebeli, University of Basel, Switzerland). It
      explains the construction and application of Nedelec
      edge elements for H-curl spaces, as used, for example,
      in the numerical solution of the Maxwell equations. It
      also gives numerical results obtained with deal.II.
    </li>

    <li>
      A report on the
      <a href="http://www.dealii.org/reports/codimension-one/desimone-heltai-manigrasso.pdf"
         target="body">codimension one</a> capabilities of the library
         (by Antonio DeSimone, Luca Heltai and Cataldo Manigrasso,
         SISSA, Trieste, Italy). It explains in detail how to use the
         library for the solution of problems defined on codimension
         one manifolds, such as, for example, Boundary Element
         Methods.
      </li>
  </ul>
