</div><!--header-->
<div class="contents">
<div class="textblock"><p>This is the main starting page for the deal.II class and function documentation. Documentation on other aspects, such as the build system, can be found elsewhere. In addition, there are <a href="Tutorial.html">Tutorial programs on the use of the library</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the classes in the deal.II library can be grouped into modules (see the <a href="modules.html">Modules page</a> or the corresponding entry in the menu at the top of this page). These modules form around the building blocks of any finite element program. An outline of how the primary groups of classes in deal.II interact is given by the following clickable graph, with a more detailed description below:</p>
<div align="center">
<iframe scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="dot_inline_dotgraph_2.svg" width="582" height="376"><p><b>This browser is not able to show SVG: try Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Opera instead.</b></p></iframe></div>
<p>These groups are all covered in the tutorial programs, with a first overview of how they fit together given in <a class="el" href="step_3.html">step-3</a>. The following is a guide to this classification of groups, as well as links to the documentation pertaining to each of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="startli"><b>Triangulation</b>: Triangulations are collections of cells and their lower-dimensional boundary objects. Cells are images of the reference hypercube [0,1]<sup>dim</sup> under a suitable mapping in the module on <a class="el" href="group__mapping.html">Mappings between reference and real cell</a>.</p>
<p>The triangulation stores geometric and topological properties of a mesh: how are the cells connected and where are their vertices. A triangulation doesn't know anything about the finite elements that you may want to used on this mesh, and a triangulation does not even know anything about the shape of its cells: in 2d it only knows that a cell has 4 faces (lines) and 4 vertices (and in 3d that it has 6 faces (quadrilaterals), 12 lines, and 8 vertices), but everything else is defined by a mapping class.</p>
<p>The properties and data of triangulations are almost always queried through loops over all cells, possibly querying all faces of each cell as well. Most of the knowledge about a mesh is therefore hidden behind <em>iterators</em>, i.e. pointer-like structures that one can iterate from one cell to the next, and that one can ask for information about the cell it presently points to.</p>
<p>The classes that describe triangulations and cells are located and documented in the <a class="el" href="group__grid.html">Grid classes</a> module. Iterators are described in the <a class="el" href="group__Iterators.html">Iterators on mesh-like containers</a> module.</p>
<pre class="fragment"> &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Finite Element&lt;/b&gt;: Finite element classes describe the
 properties of a finite element space as defined on the unit
 cell. This includes, for example, how many degrees of freedom are
 located at vertices, on lines, or in the interior of cells. In
 addition to this, finite element classes of course have to
 provide values and gradients of individual shape functions at
 points on the unit cell.

 The finite element classes are described in the @ref feall module.


 &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;%Quadrature&lt;/b&gt;: As with finite elements, quadrature
 objects are defined on the unit cell. They only describe the
 location of quadrature points on the unit cell, and the weights
 of quadrature points thereon.

 The documentation of the classes describing particular quadrature
 formulas is found in the @ref Quadrature module.


 &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;%DoFHandler&lt;/b&gt;: %DoFHandler objects are the confluence
 of triangulations and finite elements: the finite element class
 describes how many degrees of freedom it needs per vertex, line,
 or cell, and the DoFHandler class allocates this space so that
 each vertex, line, or cell of the triangulation has the correct
 number of them. It also gives them a global numbering.

 A different viewpoint is this: While the mesh and finite element describe
 abstract properties of the the finite dimensional space \form#120 in which we
 seek the discrete solution, the %DoFHandler classes enumerate a concrete
 basis of this space so that we can represent the discrete solution as
</pre><p> <img class="formulaInl" alt="$u_h(\mathbf x)= \sum_j U_j \varphi_i(\mathbf x)$" src="form_121.png"/> by an ordered set of coefficients <img class="formulaInl" alt="$U_j$" src="form_122.png"/>.</p>
<p>Just as with triangulation objects, most operations on DoFHandlers are done by looping over all cells and doing something on each or a subset of them. The interfaces of the two classes are therefore rather similar: they allow to get iterators to the first and last cell (or face, or line, etc) and offer information through these iterators. The information that can be gotten from these iterators is the geometric and topological information that can already be gotten from the triangulation iterators (they are in fact derived classes) as well as things like the global numbers of the degrees of freedom on the present cell. On can also ask an iterator to extract the values corresponding to the degrees of freedom on the present cell from a data vector that stores values for all degrees of freedom associated with a triangulation.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that, just as triangulations, <a class="el" href="classDoFHandler.html">DoFHandler</a> classes do not know anything about the mapping from the unit cell to its individual cells. It is also ignorant of the shape functions that correspond to the degrees of freedom it manages: all it knows is that there are, for example, 2 degrees of freedom for each vertex and 4 per cell interior. Nothing about their specifics is relevant to the <a class="el" href="classDoFHandler.html">DoFHandler</a> class with the exception of the fact that they exist.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="classDoFHandler.html">DoFHandler</a> class and its associates are described in the <a class="el" href="group__dofs.html">Degrees of Freedom</a> module. In addition, there are specialized versions that can handle multilevel and hp discretizations. These are described in the <a class="el" href="group__mg.html">Multilevel support</a> and <a class="el" href="group__hp.html">hp finite element support</a> modules. Finite element methods frequently imply constraints on degrees of freedom, such as for hanging nodes or nodes at which boundary conditions apply; dealing with such constraints is described in the <a class="el" href="group__constraints.html">Constraints on degrees of freedom</a> module.</p>
<pre class="fragment"> &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;%Mapping&lt;/b&gt;: The next step in a finite element program
 is that one would want to compute matrix and right hand side
 entries or other quantities on each cell of a triangulation,
 using the shape functions of a finite element and quadrature
 points defined by a quadrature rule. To this end, it is necessary
 to map the shape functions, quadrature points, and quadrature
 weights from the unit cell to each cell of a triangulation. This
 is not directly done by, but facilitated by the Mapping and
 derived classes: they describe how to map points from unit to
 real space and back, as well as provide gradients of this
 derivative and Jacobian determinants.

 These classes are all described in the @ref mapping module.


 &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;%FEValues&lt;/b&gt;: The next step is to actually take a finite
 element and evaluate its shape functions and their gradients at
 the points defined by a quadrature formula when mapped to the
 real cell. This is the realm of the FEValues class and siblings:
 in a sense, they offer a point-wise view of the finite element
 function space.

 This seems restrictive: in mathematical analysis, we always write
 our formulas in terms of integrals over cells, or faces of cells,
 involving the finite element shape functions. One would therefore
 think that it is necessary to describe finite element spaces as
 continuous spaces. However, in practice, this is not necessary:
 all integrals are in actual computations replaced by
 approximations using quadrature formula, and what is therefore
 really only necessary is the ability to evaluate shape functions
 at a finite number of given locations inside a domain. The
 FEValues classes offer exactly this information: Given finite
 element, quadrature, and mapping objects, they compute the
 restriction of a continuous function space (as opposed to
 discrete, not as opposed to discontinuous) to a discrete number
 of points.

 There are a number of objects that can do this: FEValues for
 evaluation on cells, FEFaceValues for evaluation on faces of
 cells, and FESubfaceValues for evaluation on parts of faces of
 cells. All these classes are described in the @ref feaccess
 module.


 &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Linear Systems&lt;/b&gt;: If one knows how to evaluate the
 values and gradients of shape functions on individual cells using
 FEValues and friends, and knows how to get the global numbers of
 the degrees of freedom on a cell using the DoFHandler iterators,
 then the next step is to use the bilinear form of the problem to
 assemble the system matrix (and right hand side) of the linear
 system. We will then determine the solution of our problem from
 this linear system.

 To do this, we need to have classes that store and manage the
 entries of matrices and vectors. deal.II comes with a whole set
 of classes for this purpose, as well as with interfaces to other
 software packages that offer similar functionality. Documentation
 to this end can be found in the @ref LAC module.


 &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Linear Solvers&lt;/b&gt;: In order to determine the solution of
 a finite-dimensional, linear system of equations, one needs
 linear solvers. In finite element applications, they are
 frequently iterative, but sometimes one may also want to use
 direct or sparse direct solvers. deal.II has quite a number of
 these. They are documented in the @ref Solvers module.


 &lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Output&lt;/b&gt;: Finally, once one has obtained a solution of
 a finite element problem on a given triangulation, one will often
 want to postprocess it using a visualization program. This
 library doesn't do the visualization by itself, but rather generates output
 files in a variety of graphics formats understood by widely
 available visualization tools.

 A description of the classes that do so is given in the @ref
 output module.

</ol>
<p>In addition, deal.II has a number of groups of classes that go beyond the ones listed here. They pertain to more refined concepts of the hierarchy presented above, or to tangential aspects like handling of input and output that are not necessarily specific to finite element programs, but appear there as well. These classes are all listed in the Classes and Namespaces views reachable from the menu bar at the top of this page, and are also grouped into modules of their own (see the <a href="modules.html">Modules linke</a> at the top of this page).</p>
<p>We provide the Doxygen tag file for those of you who would like to directly link the documentation of application programs to the deal.II online documentation. The tag file is at <a href="../deal.tag"><code>deal.tag</code></a>. For each release of deal.II, it resides in the directory right above the Doxygen reference documentation. In order to use the tag file, you have to download it into a place where Doxygen can find it. After that, find the key <code>TAGFILES</code> in your Doxygen options file and write something like </p>
<pre>
   TAGFILES = deal.tag=<a href="http://www.dealii.org/X.Y.Z/doxygen/deal.II">http://www.dealii.org/X.Y.Z/doxygen/deal.II</a>
  </pre><p> where <code>X.Y.Z</code> refers to the release you want to link to. Be sure you use the matching tag file. In theory, you can also link against the developing revisions of deal.II, but then you have to fear that your links may become invalid if the deal.II structure changes. </p>
